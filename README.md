# dunce-cap

This project uses some libraries from Boost, so to build this, you might need to add boost libraries to your include path (something like this: 'export CPATH=$CPATH:/usr/local/boost_1_57_0').

### TODO:
* parallelize using OpenMP tasks: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenMP/Tasks
* cleanup JSON files: prune should be a literal bool, not a string
